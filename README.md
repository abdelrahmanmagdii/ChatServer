# ChatServer
This is a simple client-server chat java application that allows two or more devices to send each other messages over a socket. This was completed as a side project and is still missing some features.

This project uses Java version 8  and gradle 6.3

To run this program, you first need to turn on running multiple instances for your compiler. 
Start off by running the ChatServer class, and then run multiple ChatClient depending on the number of users required in your test run.

Currently, the option to create a new user has yet to be implemented. Therefore a list of possible id/password combinations can be found below

1. UID: 1 | Password: 1
2. UID: 2 | Password: a
3. UID: 3 | Password: b
4. UID: 4 | Password: b
